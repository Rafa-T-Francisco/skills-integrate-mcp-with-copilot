## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint                                                          | Description                                                         |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/activities`                                                     | Get all activities with their details and current participant count |
| POST   | `/activities/{activity_name}/signup?email=student@mergington.edu` | Sign up for an activity                                             |

## Data Model

The application uses a simple data model with meaningful identifiers:

1. **Activities** - Uses activity name as identifier:

   - Description
   - Schedule
   - Maximum number of participants allowed
   - List of student emails who are signed up

2. **Students** - Uses email as identifier:
   - Name
   - Grade level

## Data Storage

Activities and participant registrations are stored in SQLite and persist when the
server restarts. The application creates `src/activities.sqlite` automatically
on its first run and seeds it with the sample activities and registrations.
Existing database contents are not overwritten on later starts.

To use a different database location, set `ACTIVITIES_DB_PATH` before starting
the application. Ensure the configured location is on persistent storage when
deploying the app; an ephemeral filesystem will not preserve the database across
redeployments.
